# Important Disclaimers

## ⚠️ DEMONSTRATION SYSTEM - NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE

This system is an **EDUCATIONAL DEMONSTRATION** and **PROOF OF CONCEPT** only. It is **NOT intended for production use** in any real-world insurance or claims processing scenarios.

## Purpose

This system is designed to:
- **Educate** developers and students about Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- **Demonstrate** how LLM agents can be integrated with DDD patterns
- **Showcase** event-driven architecture principles
- **Illustrate** human-in-the-loop workflows

## Limitations

### Not Production-Ready

This system has **significant limitations** that make it unsuitable for production:

1. **No Data Persistence**: Uses in-memory storage only
2. **No Security**: No authentication, authorization, or data encryption
3. **No Scalability**: Not designed for concurrent production loads
4. **No Error Recovery**: Limited error handling and recovery mechanisms
5. **No Monitoring**: No production monitoring or alerting
6. **No Compliance**: Not compliant with insurance regulations (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.)
7. **No Audit Trail**: Limited audit and compliance features
8. **Mock Data**: Uses simplified, mock data for demonstration

### LLM Limitations

- **Accuracy**: LLM outputs are not guaranteed to be accurate
- **Hallucination**: LLMs may generate incorrect or fabricated information
- **Bias**: LLMs may exhibit biases present in training data
- **No Validation**: Limited validation of LLM outputs against real-world data
- **Cost**: Using cloud LLMs incurs costs; local models have quality limitations

### Educational Purpose Only

- **Simplified Domain**: Real insurance domains are far more complex
- **Missing Features**: Many production features are not implemented
- **No Support**: No production support or maintenance provided
- **No Warranty**: Provided "as-is" without any warranties

## Use Cases

### ✅ Appropriate Uses

- Educational demonstrations
- Learning DDD patterns
- Understanding LLM integration
- Prototyping concepts
- Academic research
- Code examples and tutorials

### ❌ Inappropriate Uses

- **DO NOT** use for real insurance claims processing
- **DO NOT** use for any production financial systems
- **DO NOT** use for handling real customer data
- **DO NOT** use for compliance-critical applications
- **DO NOT** use without understanding limitations

## Data and Privacy

- **No Real Data**: Do not use real customer or policy data
- **No PII**: Do not process personally identifiable information
- **No Sensitive Data**: Do not use sensitive or confidential information
- **Demo Data Only**: Use only synthetic, demo data

## Liability

**THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND**, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.

## Recommendations

If you need a production system:

1. **Start Fresh**: Don't use this codebase as a foundation
2. **Security First**: Implement proper security from the start
3. **Compliance**: Ensure regulatory compliance
4. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive testing
5. **Monitoring**: Add production monitoring
6. **Documentation**: Create production documentation
7. **Support**: Plan for production support
8. **Legal Review**: Have legal/compliance review before production use

## For Production

This system demonstrates concepts but should **NOT** be used as-is for production. For production use:

- Implement proper database persistence
- Add authentication and authorization
- Implement security best practices
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Implement monitoring and alerting
- Ensure regulatory compliance
- Add audit trails
- Implement proper testing
- Plan for scalability
- Add production support
