Subject: Auto Insurance Claim - Rear End Collision

Dear Insurance Company,

I am writing to file a claim for a car accident that occurred on January 15, 2024, at approximately 2:30 PM.

The incident happened at the intersection of Main Street and Oak Avenue in Anytown, State 12345. I was stopped at a red light when another vehicle rear-ended my car. The other driver ran a red light and hit me from behind.

My vehicle sustained significant damage to the rear bumper, trunk, and rear lights. I have obtained an estimate from a local auto body shop, and the repair costs are approximately $3,500.00.

I have been a customer with your company for 5 years and my policy number is POL-2024-001234. I would appreciate if you could process this claim as soon as possible.

Best regards,
John Doe
